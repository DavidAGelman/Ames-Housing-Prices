Working with the Ames housing data to build a predictive model of Sale Price

This notebook walks through my approach to creating a model to predict the sale price for residential properties in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010.  A key challenge to using this dataset is the number of features and messiness of the data.

My best performing model explains 97% of the variance in the in-sample data and just over 90% in the out-of-sample hold-out set.  At the end of my notebook I offer some reflections and conclusions about the data and modeling exercise.
